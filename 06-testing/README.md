# Section 06: Testing

If you're writing code that matters, you need to test it. Testing isn't just about catching bugs — it's about building confidence that your code works and will keep working as you make changes. This is a non-negotiable skill for any serious developer.

## Lessons

| # | Lesson | Description |
|---|--------|-------------|
| 01 | [unittest Basics](01-unittest-basics/) | Python's built-in testing framework |
| 02 | [pytest Basics](02-pytest-basics/) | The most popular Python testing framework |
| 03 | [Mocking](03-mocking/) | Isolating code by faking dependencies |
| 04 | [Test-Driven Development](04-test-driven-development/) | Writing tests first to drive your design |

## What You'll Be Able to Do After This Section

- Write unit tests using both unittest and pytest
- Use mocking to test code in isolation
- Practice TDD to write better, more testable code
- Structure test suites for real-world projects
- Understand test coverage and what makes a good test

## Prerequisites

- [Section 01: Fundamentals](../01-fundamentals/)
- [Section 04: OOP](../04-oop/) — for understanding test classes
- [Section 05: Intermediate](../05-intermediate/) — especially error handling and decorators
