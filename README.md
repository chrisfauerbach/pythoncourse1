# Learn Python — From Zero to Machine Learning

Welcome! This repo is a hands-on, self-paced guide to learning Python. Whether you've never written a line of code or you're looking to level up into data processing and machine learning, there's something here for you.

## How This Repo Works

- **Each section** is a numbered folder covering a major topic area
- **Each lesson** inside a section has its own folder with:
  - `README.md` — explains the concept in plain language
  - `example.py` — a working, runnable example you can study and tinker with
  - `exercises.py` — practice problems to test your understanding (solutions included!)
- **Lessons build on each other** within a section, but sections are fairly self-contained — feel free to jump around if you already know the basics

## Getting Started

You'll need Python 3.8+ installed. Check with:

```bash
python3 --version
```

To run any example:

```bash
cd 01-fundamentals/01-hello-world
python3 example.py
```

That's it. No complicated setup, no virtual environments needed (until we get to the data science sections).

## The Roadmap

### Beginner

| # | Section | What You'll Learn |
|---|---------|-------------------|
| 01 | [Fundamentals](01-fundamentals/) | Variables, I/O, control flow, loops, functions — the building blocks |
| 02 | [Data Structures](02-data-structures/) | Lists, dictionaries, sets, and comprehensions |
| 03 | [File I/O](03-file-io/) | Reading and writing text, CSV, and JSON files |
| 04 | [Object-Oriented Programming](04-oop/) | Classes, inheritance, and thinking in objects |

### Intermediate

| # | Section | What You'll Learn |
|---|---------|-------------------|
| 05 | [Intermediate Concepts](05-intermediate/) | Error handling, decorators, generators, and more |
| 06 | [Testing](06-testing/) | Unit tests, pytest, mocking, and test-driven development |
| 07 | [Async Python](07-async-python/) | async/await, asyncio, and concurrent programming |
| 08 | [Working with Data](08-working-with-data/) | Regex, datetime, collections, and itertools |

### Advanced

| # | Section | What You'll Learn |
|---|---------|-------------------|
| 09 | [Data Processing](09-data-processing/) | NumPy, Pandas, data cleaning, and visualization |
| 10 | [APIs & Web](10-apis-and-web/) | HTTP requests, REST APIs, web scraping, and async HTTP |
| 11 | [Databases](11-databases/) | SQLite, SQLAlchemy, and async database access |
| 12 | [Machine Learning](12-machine-learning/) | ML concepts, scikit-learn, and neural networks |

### Projects

| # | Section | What You'll Learn |
|---|---------|-------------------|
| 13 | [Mini Projects](13-projects/) | Guided projects that combine skills from multiple sections |

## Tips for Learning

- **Type the code yourself** instead of copy-pasting. Muscle memory matters.
- **Break things on purpose.** Change a variable, remove a line, see what happens.
- **Do the exercises.** Reading code is not the same as writing code.
- **Don't skip the fundamentals.** Sections 01-04 are the foundation everything else is built on.

## Prerequisites

- A computer with Python 3.8+ installed
- A text editor or IDE (VS Code, PyCharm, or even Notepad — whatever you're comfortable with)
- Curiosity and willingness to experiment
