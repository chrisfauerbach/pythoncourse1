# Section 09: Data Processing

Time to bring in the big guns. NumPy and Pandas are the backbone of Python's data science ecosystem. If you're working with datasets, crunching numbers, or building visualizations, this is where it gets exciting.

**Note:** This section requires installing third-party packages. Each lesson includes setup instructions.

## Lessons

| # | Lesson | Description |
|---|--------|-------------|
| 01 | [NumPy Basics](01-numpy-basics/) | Fast numerical computing with arrays |
| 02 | [Pandas Basics](02-pandas-basics/) | DataFrames for tabular data analysis |
| 03 | [Data Cleaning](03-data-cleaning/) | Handling missing data, duplicates, and messy inputs |
| 04 | [Visualization](04-visualization/) | Creating charts and plots with matplotlib |

## Setup

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
```
