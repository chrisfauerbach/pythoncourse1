# Section 05: Intermediate Concepts

You've got the fundamentals down — now it's time to write code like a Pythonista. This section covers the features that separate beginners from intermediate developers. These patterns show up everywhere in production Python code.

## Lessons

| # | Lesson | Description |
|---|--------|-------------|
| 01 | [Error Handling](01-error-handling/) | Gracefully dealing with things that go wrong |
| 02 | [Decorators](02-decorators/) | Wrapping functions to add behavior |
| 03 | [Generators](03-generators/) | Lazy iteration for memory-efficient processing |
| 04 | [Context Managers](04-context-managers/) | Managing resources with `with` statements |
| 05 | [Modules and Packages](05-modules-and-packages/) | Organizing code across files and directories |
| 06 | [Lambda and Closures](06-lambda-and-closures/) | Anonymous functions and captured state |

## What You'll Be Able to Do After This Section

- Write robust code that handles errors gracefully
- Create and use decorators to add cross-cutting functionality
- Use generators to process large datasets without blowing up memory
- Manage resources (files, connections, locks) safely
- Structure larger projects into modules and packages

## Prerequisites

- [Section 01: Fundamentals](../01-fundamentals/)
- [Section 04: OOP](../04-oop/) — helpful for context managers and decorators
