# Section 02: Data Structures

Now that you know the basics, it's time to learn how Python organizes and stores collections of data. These data structures are the workhorses of Python programming — you'll use them constantly.

## Lessons

| # | Lesson | Description |
|---|--------|-------------|
| 01 | [Lists and Tuples](01-lists-and-tuples/) | Ordered collections — mutable and immutable |
| 02 | [Dictionaries](02-dictionaries/) | Key-value pairs for fast lookups |
| 03 | [Sets](03-sets/) | Unique collections and set operations |
| 04 | [Comprehensions](04-comprehensions/) | Pythonic one-liners for building collections |

## What You'll Be Able to Do After This Section

- Choose the right data structure for any problem
- Store, access, and manipulate collections of data
- Write clean, Pythonic code using comprehensions
- Understand when to use a list vs. a dict vs. a set

## Prerequisites

- [Section 01: Fundamentals](../01-fundamentals/) — especially loops and functions
