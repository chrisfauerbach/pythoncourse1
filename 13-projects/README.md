# Section 13: Mini Projects

You've learned the concepts — now put them together. This section has guided projects that combine skills from multiple sections into real, working programs. Each project includes a description of what to build, a starter file with the structure laid out, and a complete reference solution.

## Projects

| # | Project | Skills Used | Difficulty |
|---|---------|-------------|------------|
| 01 | [Number Guessing Game](01-number-guessing-game/) | Variables, loops, conditionals, input, random | Beginner |
| 02 | [Todo CLI](02-todo-cli/) | File I/O, JSON, argparse, lists, functions | Intermediate |
| 03 | [Contact Book](03-contact-book/) | OOP, file persistence, error handling, search | Intermediate |
| 04 | [Web API Client](04-web-api-client/) | HTTP requests, JSON, argparse, error handling | Advanced |

## How These Projects Work

Each project folder contains:

- **`README.md`** — what to build, features to implement, and hints
- **`starter.py`** — a skeleton with the structure and function signatures already laid out. Fill in the logic.
- **`solution.py`** — a complete, working reference implementation. Try not to peek until you've given it a solid attempt!

## Tips

- **Start with the starter file.** The structure is there for a reason — it breaks the problem into manageable pieces.
- **Build incrementally.** Get the simplest version working first, then add features one at a time.
- **Test as you go.** Run your script after every small change. Don't write 50 lines and then run it for the first time.
- **It's okay to look at the solution.** If you're stuck for more than 15-20 minutes on a single piece, glance at the solution for that part, understand it, then close it and write it yourself.
- **Make it your own.** Once the basic version works, add your own features! Change the game rules, add color output, save high scores — whatever sounds fun.

## Prerequisites

- Sections 01–05 for the first three projects
- Section 10 (APIs & Web) for the Web API Client project
