# Section 08: Working with Data

Python's standard library is packed with powerful modules for processing data. Before reaching for third-party libraries, learn what's already built in — these tools will solve a surprising number of real-world problems.

## Lessons

| # | Lesson | Description |
|---|--------|-------------|
| 01 | [Regex](01-regex/) | Pattern matching and text extraction |
| 02 | [Datetime](02-datetime/) | Working with dates, times, and timezones |
| 03 | [Collections Module](03-collections-module/) | Specialized containers beyond the basics |
| 04 | [itertools](04-itertools/) | Powerful iteration building blocks |

## What You'll Be Able to Do After This Section

- Extract and validate data with regular expressions
- Handle dates, times, and timezones correctly
- Use Counter, defaultdict, namedtuple, and deque
- Combine itertools functions for elegant data pipelines
