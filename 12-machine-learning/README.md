# Section 12: Machine Learning

The grand finale. Machine learning is where Python really shines. This section won't make you an ML expert overnight, but it will give you a solid foundation to understand what ML is, how it works, and how to build your first models.

**Note:** This section requires installing third-party packages. Each lesson includes setup instructions.

## Lessons

| # | Lesson | Description |
|---|--------|-------------|
| 01 | [ML Concepts](01-ml-concepts/) | What is ML? Types of learning, key terminology |
| 02 | [scikit-learn Basics](02-scikit-learn-basics/) | Your first ML models — classification and regression |
| 03 | [Simple Neural Network](03-simple-neural-network/) | Building a neural network from scratch and with PyTorch |

## Setup

```bash
pip install scikit-learn torch numpy pandas matplotlib
```

## What You'll Be Able to Do After This Section

- Understand the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning
- Train classification and regression models with scikit-learn
- Evaluate model performance with proper metrics
- Build a simple neural network

## Prerequisites

- [Section 09: Data Processing](../09-data-processing/) — NumPy and Pandas are essential
- A basic understanding of math (mean, standard deviation, basic algebra)
