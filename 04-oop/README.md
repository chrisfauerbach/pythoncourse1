# Section 04: Object-Oriented Programming

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a way of organizing your code around "objects" — bundles of data and the functions that operate on that data. Python is an object-oriented language at its core, and understanding OOP unlocks a whole new level of code organization.

## Lessons

| # | Lesson | Description |
|---|--------|-------------|
| 01 | [Classes and Objects](01-classes-and-objects/) | Creating your own types with classes |
| 02 | [Inheritance](02-inheritance/) | Building on existing classes |
| 03 | [Magic Methods](03-magic-methods/) | Customizing how your objects behave |
| 04 | [Dataclasses](04-dataclasses/) | The modern, lightweight way to define data containers |

## What You'll Be Able to Do After This Section

- Design and implement your own classes
- Use inheritance to share behavior between classes
- Make your objects work with Python's built-in operators
- Use dataclasses to reduce boilerplate

## Prerequisites

- [Section 01: Fundamentals](../01-fundamentals/) — especially functions
- [Section 02: Data Structures](../02-data-structures/)
